    "# 2. Stateful Conversations with Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "To build intelligent chatbots, an LLM needs to remember past interactions. This notebook explores LangChain's `Memory` modules, which provide the context necessary for stateful conversations. We cover various strategies for managing conversation history, from simple buffers that store recent messages (`ConversationBufferWindowMemory`) to more advanced techniques that summarize the entire dialogue (`ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`) to manage token limits effectively."
