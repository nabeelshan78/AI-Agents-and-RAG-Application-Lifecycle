# LangChain: Engineering End-to-End LLM Applications ðŸ¦œðŸ”—

This repository contains end-to-end engineering of sophisticated applications using the **LangChain framework**. It moves beyond simple examples to showcase the complete lifecycle of modern AI systems: from architecture and implementation to quantitative evaluation.

---

## Core Competencies Developed

Systematically built the following core competencies:

-   **LLM Interface Mastery**: Engineer and control LLM interactions through advanced prompting and structured output parsing.
-   **Context & State Management**: Implement and manage conversational memory to build stateful, context-aware applications.
-   **Workflow Orchestration**: Architect complex, multi-step logic by chaining LLM calls and other components.
-   **RAG Pipeline Architecture**: Construct end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Q&A over private data sources.
-   **Quantitative System Evaluation**: Develop and execute frameworks for the systematic validation and performance testing of LLM applications.
-   **Autonomous Agent Design**: Build agents that can reason, delegate tasks to tools, and execute actions to solve complex problems.

## Modular Breakdown

The repository is structured as a sequential series of modules.

| Module | Notebook                                                                      | Core Objective                                                                                        |
| :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **04** | [**Q&A over Custom Data**](./04_Question_Answering_over_Custom_Data.ipynb)      | Implement the full RAG pipeline: data ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and synthesis.                 |
| **05** | [**Evaluating Performance**](./05_Evaluating_Q&A_System_Performance.ipynb)      | Establish a rigorous evaluation protocol to quantitatively measure the accuracy of the Q&A system.      |
| **06** | [**Building Autonomous Agents**](./06_Autonomous_Agents_with_Tools.ipynb) | Design and deploy agents that leverage external tools to execute tasks autonomously.                    |
