    "This notebook implements a complete Question-Answering system using the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern. We walk through the end-to-end process of loading custom documents (a CSV catalog), creating vector embeddings for semantic search, and building a `RetrievalQA` chain. This allows the LLM to answer questions by first retrieving relevant information from our private data, enabling powerful, context-aware applications."
